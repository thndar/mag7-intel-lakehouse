-- 1. Get base prices from staging table
WITH prices AS (

    open,
    high,
    low,
    close,

-- 2. Add lags needed for returns & ATR calc
lagged AS (

    LAG(adj_close, 1)  OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS prev_adj_close_1,
    LAG(adj_close, 5)  OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS prev_adj_close_5,

    LAG(close, 1)      OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS prev_close

-- 3. Compute point-in-time metrics: returns, true range (for ATR)
returns AS (

      high - low,
      ABS(high - prev_close),
      ABS(low  - prev_close)
    ) AS true_range

),

-- 4. Add *forward* prices for forward-return calculations
forward AS (

    LEAD(adj_close,  1) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS next_adj_close_1,
    LEAD(adj_close,  5) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS next_adj_close_5,

    LEAD(adj_close, 20) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY trade_date) AS next_adj_close_20
